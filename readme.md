## Activity 5: Feedback on Education Pathways application

Upon running the Education Pathways application, the functional requirement that I would like to improve on is making the course cart/visualization feature available for users. In this way, users will be able to keep the records of all the courses that they would be interested to take in the future with the visual representation that shows how will potential timetable look like if those courses were to be chosen. 

Searching through courses in Education Pathways application was challenging for me. Therefore the non-functional requirements that I would like to improve for this website would be making search terms able to process more than one keyword by creating filters(tags) that could be applied or deleted. To be more specific, every search term would create a tag/filter that renders a list of courses based on the relevancy of the information between the tag/filter and the course name/course description/course prerequisite. Additional information inputted to the search term section would be appended to the list of tags/filters, making the search results more relevant to what users are looking for. For instance, if users first search for "math" and then search for "computers", it will search for courses that contain these two keywords and shows the list of courses in the order of relevancy. In the future, we could also utilize the data of what users searched and what they eventually selected to adopt a recommendation algorithm to our system. For now, an improvement on how search terms queries as alone would improve the usability of Education Pathways application.
